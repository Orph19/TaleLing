# What is TaleLing?
Hi. my name is Jhosver. "TaleLing" is a web app I created having in mind the natural ability of the brain to learn a language effortlesly
if it receives understandable information in the target language naturally.

# Stories
A finction book can make one get lost in it, eagerly turning pages to see what happens next. It is quite an immersive and effortless situation. 
But what else can be obtained from it apart from going to a different world? What if you could use this to learn a new language? 

# A language story
Learning languages have been "gamified", "systematized" and offered widely trough the world as a rigid service. But any healthy child 
learns its native language without putting any effort in it. You and I learned a language like that, rigth?. It happened natuaraly. 
Then, why is it that one have to strugle to learn a different language? 

When I "started" learning English I experimented with a few ways
of receiving information in English: first only hearing and watching; after I tried, hearing, watching and reading; then only reading. 
It was clear that no one worked, but then this combination appeared: seeing and reading.

## Getting acostumed
After years of only reading things in Spanish, I was not acostumed to seeing a whole text written in English, less to even go and read it. So, to
start and avoid getting overwhelmed I asked myself this: what has small sentences (or short text content) combined with visual aid?.

That was the key. After huge imersion, soon I got completely accostumed to reading written English, and large whole texts looked as something with 
meaning instead of a big block of letters. 

## Learning a language

I'm skipping a few details, but the core idea is to taclke small chunks of text, have an aid to understand the meaning of the words (images
and a translator) AND, to feel totally immerse in what is being readed. This is the secret to learn any language fast and efortleslly.

Note: I did not spent a penny while "learning" english, there are many free options that can be mixed to obtain what I mentioned. 

# TaleLing

I created TaleLing as a resource that includes all of that in one. This repository contains all the code of TaleLing. It started as a proyect for a
hackaton in devpost. After that I decided to make it real, and see if it could help anyone. From the devpost project to the current version it was a 
a wide journey. 

## No code experience
I coded for the first time a few years ago, but to me it appeared vague, so I stop coding. This year I started using python and to try seeing the logic
of coding. A bit after was when I tried out making a web app for a hackaton in devpost, I had no clue how to do it but AI helped. 

## Vibe coding? 
Not sure what is that, but months ago AI was unreliable and weeks ago it still was. Anyway, I used AI to code the bases and see how developers coded
in reality. I made many things, tweak the things AI made and in the case of the frontend it was all made with prompts. There were
many bugs, *many*, but after many "conversations" with AI, and after many days coding myself things (following what I saw in the outputs of the AI)
it was done. At some point I started using some basic concepts like Separation of concerns (SoC) and to use reusable functions to reduce bugs. 

## End of the journey
